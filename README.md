# Skin-Cancer-Prediction
This project focuses on the detection and classification of skin lesions as either cancerous or non-cancerous, addressing the growing global burden of skin cancer. Leveraging a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, I explored essential lesion features (e.g., texture, morphology, and color) that contribute to accurate diagnosis.

üìå Key Objectives:

Classify skin lesions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Identify key predictive features with Logistic Regression to enhance interpretability.

üìä Methodology:

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahdavi1202/skin-cancer  
                     https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdismielhossenabir/skin-cancer-or-not-skin-cancer-image-datasets

Preprocessing: Unwanted variables were removed; feature extraction and image preprocessing were applied.

Classification Model: CNN for image-based classification.

Feature Importance: Logistic Regression to determine key features influencing classification outcomes.

‚ùì Research Questions:

How accurately can we classify skin lesions using their visual and structural features?

What are the most important features that contribute to classification accuracy?

üîç Outcome:
This dual-model approach not only aimed to achieve high accuracy in skin cancer detection, but also to enhance model interpretability, making it more suitable for clinical application in dermatology.
